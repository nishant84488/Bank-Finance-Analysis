\# üè¶ Power BI Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis: From SQL to Strategy



This project delivers a complete, end-to-end financial analysis of a bank's lending portfolio. It is anchored by a detailed methodology and culminates in a dynamic, interactive \*\*Power BI Dashboard\*\*.



The goal is to provide executive and risk management teams with clear, real-time insights to assess portfolio health, track growth, and proactively manage risk exposure.

\## üìÇ Project Repository Files



This repository contains both the documentation and the final presentation layer of the financial model.



| File Name | Description | Role in Project |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*`Bank Finance Project.docx`\*\* | The comprehensive project documentation. | Contains the \*\*business requirements\*\*, \*\*data dictionary\*\*, and all the \*\*underlying SQL queries\*\* (e.g., `SUM(loan\_amount)`, `AVG(dti)`) used to calculate the dashboard metrics. |

| \*\*`finance project final Dashbord.pbix`\*\* | The final analytical output. | The interactive \*\*Power BI Dashboard file\*\* containing all the visualizations, key performance indicators (KPIs), and detailed reports. |

\## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) \& Metrics



The analysis is driven by robust SQL and DAX logic to calculate three critical categories of metrics.



\### 1. Portfolio Volume \& Growth

These metrics track the scale and momentum of lending operations, essential for performance review and forecasting.



\* \*\*Total Loan Applications:\*\* Calculated using `COUNT(id)`.

\* \*\*Total Funded Amount:\*\* The total capital deployed, calculated using `SUM(loan\_amount)`.

\* \*\*Total Amount Received:\*\* The bank's cash flow, calculated using `SUM(total\_payment)`.

\* \*\*Trend Analysis:\*\* All key metrics are tracked with \*\*Month-to-Date (MTD)\*\* and \*\*Month-over-Month (MoM)\*\* comparisons for immediate identification of growth or decline trends.



\### 2. Risk \& Profitability Indicators

These are the quantitative measures of portfolio quality and return.



\* \*\*Average Interest Rate:\*\* The weighted average return on the loans, calculated using `AVG(int\_rate) \* 100`.

\* \*\*Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:\*\* A core risk metric, calculated using `AVG(dti) \* 100` to gauge the borrower's financial stress.



\### 3. Risk Management: Good vs. Bad Loans

A central feature is the binary categorization of the loan book for instant risk assessment.



| Category | Definition (based on `loan\_status`) | Key Metrics Tracked |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Good Loans\*\* | Loans that are 'Fully Paid' or 'Current'. | Success Rate (%), Total Capital Preserved, Total Returns Generated. |

| \*\*Bad Loans\*\* | Loans that have been 'Charged Off'. | Default Rate (%), Total Funded Amount lost, Payments Received before Charge-Off. |

\## üíª Technical Architecture



The project seamlessly integrates three layers of technology to create the final dashboard:



1\.  \*\*Data Source Layer:\*\* The raw data resides in a relational database table (assumed to be named `bank\_loan\_data`).

2\.  \*\*Transformation Layer (SQL/Power Query):\*\* The \*\*SQL queries\*\* outlined in the project's documentation are the brain of the analysis. They define how raw data is aggregated, categorized, and prepared for visualization.

3\.  \*\*Presentation Layer (Power BI):\*\* The pre-calculated data is imported and modeled within the \*\*`.pbix` file\*\*, where interactive charts, slicers, and scorecards are created to bring the financial story to life.



\## üöÄ Getting Started \& Viewing the Dashboard



No complex installation or environment setup is required to interact with the final output.



\### Prerequisites

\* \*\*Power BI Desktop:\*\* Required to open and view the `.pbix` file. (Available as a free download from Microsoft).



\### Instructions

1\.  Download or clone the repository.

2\.  Open the file \*\*`finance project final Dashbord.pbix`\*\* using Power BI Desktop.

3\.  The dashboard will load, allowing you to filter by status, time period, and other dimensions to explore the portfolio's performance.
